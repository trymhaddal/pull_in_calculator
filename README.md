# Pull-in calculator
This is a web-based application for generalized pull-in calculations. To launch, click this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/trymhaddal/pull_in_calculator/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FPull_in_calculations.ipynb)

Note that it might take half a minute or so to lauch. Also, the application will time out if inactive for more than 15 minutes. 

The theory used in the calculations is explained in the document "Pull-in calculation theory.pdf". Keep in mind that this application is in beta mode, so some bugs might occur. For questions, contact trym.haddal@nexans.com.

# How to use 
There are two tabs, one for controlling global parameters, and one for the geometry. In the global parameter tab, relevant friction factors are stored, as well as cable dry- and wet weight. These can be edited by clicking "Edit parameters" and then "Save parameters" when finished. This can be done before or after adjusting the geometry. In the geometry tab, choose if the section is wet/dry and pipe/roller. Then select the type of geometry and relevant dimensions. Clicking "Add Section" will append this section to the sections that are already stored. To edit a section that is already added, clik "Edit Section", specify the section number, commit the changes and click "Update". You can also remove the specified section by instead clicking "Delete". An overview of the sections and the associated pull-in tension is printed below the tabs. Also plots of the geometry and minimum required pull-in tension are printed. When all sections are added, click "Generate PDF" to generate a PDF document of the results. This will include a similar overview in table format, as well as the plots. Note that this does not actually download the document. In order to do that, click the "Download" link next to the button that appears after a few seconds.
